#
#   It runs in multithreaded mode when the number of input functions is greater than the number
#   of available CPU cores to avoid thread overuse. If more threads are running than the CPU 
#   can handle, this can result in lower performance due to the cost of switching between 
#   threads and competing for CPU resources.
#
#   Instead, when using multithreaded mode, each process will run on a separate CPU core,
#   which can increase performance on systems with multiple available CPU cores and prevent
#   thread overload.
#   
#   The function first determines the maximum number of threads to use based on the max_threads 
#   argument or the number of CPU cores if not specified. Then, it creates a ThreadPoolExecutor 
#   with the specified number of threads.
#
#   Next, it executes the functions in parallel using executor.submit() method. If the function 
#   is a tuple, it extracts the function and arguments and passes them to executor.submit().
#
#   After executing all the functions, the function waits for them to complete using the as_completed()
#   function. It then processes the results and stores them in a list. If an exception is raised 
#   during execution, it is caught and stored in the list of results.
#
#   Finally, the function returns the list of results obtained by executing the functions in parallel.
